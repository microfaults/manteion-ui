# manteion-ui

Operator console for the **faults-lab** platform. A React admin that talks only
to `manteion-go` (which in turn proxies a narrow slice of `zeus-go`). Every
screen corresponds to a step in the experiment loop defined in
`UI-DESIGN.md` — configure rules, launch experiments, inspect phase-by-phase
latency, read the verdict.

## Quickstart

```sh
# from the repo root
cd manteion-ui
corepack enable pnpm       # one-time, on systems without pnpm
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local # edit VITE_MANTEION_URL to your manteion-go
pnpm dev                   # http://localhost:5173
```

Run the full build + tests:

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

## Stack

| Concern | Pick |
|---|---|
| Build | Vite 5 + `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` |
| Framework | React 18 + TypeScript (strict) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + CSS variables (tokens from `UI-DESIGN.md §5`) |
| Components | shadcn/ui (copy-in under `src/components/ui/`) |
| Routing | TanStack Router (file-based, type-safe) |
| Server state | TanStack Query |
| Forms | `react-hook-form` + `zod` |
| Rules builder | Custom AND/OR/NOT tree + OPA-rego compile/parse under `src/lib/rego/` |
| Lint / format | Biome |
| Test | Vitest + jsdom + Testing Library |

The Figma source of truth is `MicroService Fault Testing Kit (Copy)`
(`fileKey=S7q0O6YXDJ3MbcRqQdLr03`). Tokens and shadcn primitives map 1:1
between code and design.

## What's wired vs. what's not

The UI is route-complete — every screen in `UI-DESIGN.md §7` has a route and
a shell. Many pages are intentionally stubbed with `<NotWiredYet/>` because
their backend endpoints don't exist yet. See `docs/API-NEEDED.md` for the full
backlog.

Wired today:
- `/dashboard` — reads `/api/v1/status`, `/api/v1/rules`, `/api/v1/sdk/instances`
- `/services` · `/services/:id` (detail is stubbed pending new endpoints)
- `/rules` · `/rules/:id` — full CRUD against `/api/v1/rules`, with the new
  OPA-rego match-criteria builder
- `/experiments` — renders the list shape with hoverable phase pills; the
  backing endpoints (`/api/v1/experiments`, `/api/v1/experiments/{id}/phase/…`)
  are missing, so the list is empty until manteion-go ships them

Not wired yet:
- `/faults`, `/workflows`, `/datasets`, `/runs/:id`, `/attacks`, `/settings/*`

## The OPA-rego rules builder

`src/components/rule-builder/` holds the two-tab editor:
- **Builder**: nested AND / OR / NOT groups of leaf conditions
  (`field op value`). Field catalog in `fields.ts`, operators per field.
- **Rego**: raw rego editor. Pasted rego re-parses into the builder grammar
  where possible; anything beyond the supported subset is marked "custom"
  and the builder view goes read-only.

`src/lib/rego/` implements AST ↔ rego round-tripping with a narrow but
well-tested subset. Run the tests with `pnpm test` — 8 round-trip cases cover
eq / in / matches / starts_with / numeric / NOT / dotted-key fields.

## Figma ⇄ code parity

- Tokens: `src/globals.css` mirrors the `faults-lab/tokens` variable
  collection in Figma. Same names, same values.
- Components: shadcn primitives under `src/components/ui/` correspond to the
  `Components` page in Figma (Button/\*, Badge/\*, Card, Input, Sidebar item,
  StatCard, GrafanaPanel). Two project-specific additions — `PhaseHoverCard`
  (3-variant component set) and `MatchBuilder` — live on the same Components
  page; the React counterparts are under `src/components/phase-hover-card.tsx`
  and `src/components/rule-builder/`.
- The `Rules — v1.1 (opa)` frame in Figma is the authoritative mockup for the
  redesigned rule editor — a copy of the original `Rules` frame plus three
  annotation callouts and a live instance of `MatchBuilder`.

## Conventions

- No Redux. Server state in TanStack Query, route state in the URL.
- Every API call goes through `src/lib/api/client.ts` (a Zod-validated
  fetch wrapper). Add new endpoints in `src/lib/api/<resource>.ts` and
  list them in `docs/API-NEEDED.md`.
- Mono font (`JetBrains Mono`) for every identifier, latency, and rule name;
  `Inter` for everything else.
- 8-pt grid, 48-px rows, 24-px card padding. Default shadcn radius (8/6).
